Dear LEAP recruiter,

I am a seasoned leader with nearly 15 years of personnel and business management experience in a scientific company. I have successfully seen a company through a merger and now an acquisition. My background of leading through change, along with my experience interfacing with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and working with regulators would be an asset.
I currently lead a laboratory where I have worked to engrain quality into every task that is done. I have experience managing the process flow and implementation of innovations and ensuring the people are working effectively together and cross-functionally with other teams – even with some difficult personalities on the team.
My growth mindset is best exemplified by the books I continue to read and apply. I found the book, “The Amazon Way” particularly interesting. It was a deep dive into the principles that Amazon employees use every day to inform the decisions they make. I immediately saw how it could be applied to any work setting and enacted the use of some of the principles right away. I was so impressed with them that I wanted to share my experience and gave a talk about my experience at a scientific leadership conference. It was so well received that I was invited to give the same talk at two other conferences!
If you are looking for someone who can grow a unique and critical group and position it, as well as the staff within it, for maximum success, that means you need someone who can coach the stars to keep on shining and help polish those whose luster is hidden. It means you need someone who can handle the technical details but recognizes that soft skills are a skill. You need someone who can go beyond just working with them as individuals and help form them into a high functioning team. My background and skills make me the right person for this challenge!

Sincerely,
Annie Carter
